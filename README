Locale::Maketext::Demo - using Locale::Maketext and ::Lexicon

=head1 DESCRIPTION

of building multi-language applications with Locale::Maketext
and extending this framework with new features.

    cd dir/
    perl test.pl

Read code, it's very simple.

=head1 ADVANCED

=head2 quant with placeholders for number

Usage:

    loc("[quant,_1,there are _1 object,there is _1 objects,no objects] in the system.", $num);

By default quant adds number in front of string, that is not
suitable for some languages situations, for example:

    10 objects have been created

In russian you can write the same using different ordering:

    have been created 10 objects

And in russian you change "have", "created" and "objects"
depending on number:

    Был  создан  1   объект
    Было создано 2   объекта
    Было создано 300 объектов

Even if you don't know russian you may see the difference.

=head2 list function

Usage:

    loc(
        "[list,_1,and,Player _1 won,Players _1 won,Draw]!",
        [qw(foo bar baz)],
    );

Variants:

    Draw!
    Player ruz won!
    Players foo, bar and baz won!
